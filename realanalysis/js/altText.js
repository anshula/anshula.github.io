    "1": "What is the point of this is a common question in math classes for a reason In math we are often presented the tools that answer questions without being given the questions themselves For example in math class I learned what a field was but had no idea why we used it until I realized it helped answer to the question what is a number The purpose of this book is to present the guiding philosophical questions that have led to core mathematical concepts in real analysis After all math is like philosophy but with answers I love real analysis the math of formalizing calculus You might or you might not be into that Either way this book is for you and I hope youll like analysis by the end of this book I hope its something youd want to read if youre curious about math even if you dont have to pass a real analysis class But if you are taking a class this book should teach what youd be tested on Ill be adding new pages weekly While pages are being added I hope youll feel free to skip around and read whatever looks interesting to you",
    "2": "You learned some amount of rubbish about calculus in high school even if you didnt realize it Analysis is about cleaning up that rubbish To do analysisWe have to forget everything we know about mathThen well build it back up again proving each step making sure its all true Note Analysis is about proving calculus not doing calculus For example youll prove that integrals exist but never calculate a single one ",
    "3": "Disclaimer Analysis isnt technically useful in that 1 You can rarely apply it to the real world and 2 It probably wont help you land a job But despite analysis being close to useless in a job application it is useful in that 1 The handwaving of calculus can lead to paradoxes Analysis fixes that by proving calculus rigorously 2 Analysis presents an opportunity to think and prove things in an entirely new way 3 Analysis offers escape from reality a chance to philosophize about problems that have nothing to do with your everyday life And sure analysis does have some practical applications But who cares anyway We do it because its fun ",
    "4": "Analysis came about as part of a movement in the 1700s Some mathematicians wanted math to be more pure and abstract and rely less on the crutches of figures and diagramsIt was something of a challenge perhaps to define math without relying on figures And thats probably why most analysis texts shy away from visuals because a big point of analysis was to not need visuals anymore ",
    "5": "Proving something doesnt exist can be a lot harder than proving something does exist A sociologist Jerry Lembcke ran into that problem Hed heard stories about antiwar protestors spitting on Vietnam War soldiers as they returned home to America But as Lembcke looked into the phenomenon he could find no single instance of this spitting But he couldnt say for sure that the spitting never happened If he only had to prove the spitting happened he would just have to find one account of it But how could he prove that nobody ever spat on a war veteran It would be impossible to interview every single Vietnam War veteran dead and alive The sociologist admitted that he couldnt say the spitting protestor phenomenon was untrue He could only say he found no evidence it was true ",
    "6": "So people say you cant prove a negative statement Not true Its hard But in math its possible with a proof by contradiction We start by assuming something does exist and reason through it If we find a contradiction within our reasoning we must conclude that thing does not exist But why When two people contradict each other you know one of them has got to be wrong Similarly in math if two of the lines in your proof contradict each other then theres a lie in there somewhere And if every step you took in the proof was correct then the lie cant be in any of the steps you tookThe lie must be way back in the very first assumption you made ",
    "7": "When an ancient Greek discovered that some numbers are irrational He was exiled It was heresy to say numbers were so disorderly But how could he have proven that irrational numbers exist Did he line up all the infinite fractions in the world and compare each to a number he thought was irrational He couldnt have Hed have to have checked all infinite fractions in the world before ensuring none of them was his guy That method of proof would be impossible Instead we could use proof by contradiction",
    "8": "First lets declare that 2 exists We should be explicit about the rules were going by Lets assume for the purpose of contradiction that 2 is rational Its not Then there must exist a fraction that equals 2 Lets use a p and q that have no common factors so that pq is simplified Now well show the contradiction even though we chose p and q to share no common factors they always end up sharing a factor of two Lets interrogate p and q separately Lets prove p is divisible by two Lets prove q is divisible by two So p and q share a factor of two Contradiction But all the steps we took were correct So the flaw must be in our assumption and the only thing we assumed was that 2 is rational So 2 cant be rational ",
    "9": "A friend once told me that irrational numbers dont exist in the real world What no I said Of course they do If I draw a triangle with sides of length 1 Then the hypotenuse has length 2 Thats irrational Well no she replied If you draw that length in the real world that line stops somewhere If you zoom in close enough and use a ruler youll see that the decimal digits of that length dont go on forever Even that side of length 1 you drew isnt exactly length 1 The probability that length is exactly 100000000 as you add on infinite 0s after the decimal point diminishes to 0 percent Shes right Like a lot of analysis concepts infinite decimals exist perfectly only in our heads So why bother with all of this stuff if it all only exists in our heads Well why do we do philosophy asked a friend Its not always useful And its sometimes ridiculous But it forces you to view things from a different perspective and get a fuller understanding of your assumptions And thats exactly what makes analysis so cool Its an entirely different way of thinking ",
    "10": "So what does proving that irrational numbers exist have to do with real analysis the building of calculus The purpose of proving that irrational numbers exist is to show that there are gaps in the rational line of numbers This gap is somewhat surprising since it seems that rationals are densely packed That is between every two rational numbers you can find another rational number consider the number pq2 that exists between rationals p and q So given that rationals are so dense its surprising that we found a gap at the square root of two Its not only surprising but also somewhat inconvenient that rationals have gaps Sets that dont have gaps or complete sets such as the real line are useful for building up calculus For example we know that limits are a foundational concept in calculus But a sequence might not have a limit in an incomplete set For example consider the sequence of rational numbers that slowly approaches pi 3 31 314 and so on It will have no limit in the rationals because its limit is pi ",
    "11": "Analysis is presented from the bottom up starting from basic axioms and building towards calculus But historically analysis was developed from the top down starting from calculus and going down towards the basic axioms So this is why youll start analysis and learn about things like irrationality and gaps and be thinking what the heck does this have to do with calculus It becomes clear only later And so next well next discuss ordered sets Yeah its not immediately clear how ordered sets help us build up calculus And yeah it is totally different than what we just discussed irrationality But lets just embrace the chaos ",
    "12": "Its useful to know that some numbers are bigger than others But as of now in our buildingup of calculus we havent yet introduced any concept of some numbers being bigger than others We dont have big numbers and small numbers right now We just have numbers We say that 5 is bigger than 3 only because people from a long time ago said so Thats how they decided to order 5 and 3 And so to know which numbers are bigger we need to define the order they go in Lets say that a proper way to order numbers is any way such that if you compare two of them one is equal to bigger than or lesser than the other For example a proper ordering for the set 35 can be that 3 equals 5 its not the ordering that most mathematicians go by but it does satisfy our definition of a proper ordering But an order cant be that 3 is both greater than and less than 5 And it cant be that 3 has no relation to 4 If these last two were orderings it would be impossible to answer the question which is bigger 3 or 4 First what exactly do I mean by order I mean that given two numbers the order should tell us which number is bigger For example we can ask How should we order the set 123 We could order it like 1 2 3 Or we could order it like 1 2 3 This is a proper ordering according to our definition It is just not the one that most mathematicians use Now for a tougher ordering problem How should we order the rationals The ordering cant just say that the bigger number is bigger The purpose of ordering is to define the word bigger Instead lets say our ordering is that the rational s is bigger than r when sr is positive Sounds good right But we havent defined positive Now in your head you might be thinking that its obvious how to define positive a number is positive when its bigger than zero But then our definition of positive relies on bigger positive means a number is bigger than zero and our definition of bigger relies on positive a number is bigger than another when sr is positive So for now Ill trust we all know the difference between a positive and negative number But we will formally define what positive and negative mean later Ok Now we know how to order sets So we can figure out which numbers are bigger than others "
